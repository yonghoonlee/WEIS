WISDEM Installation
-------------------

Installation with `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com>`_ is the recommended approach because of the ability to create self-contained environments suitable for testing and analysis.  WISDEM requires `Anaconda 64-bit <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_.

Configure Anaconda Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The installation instructions below use the environment name, "wisdem-env," but any name is acceptable.

Setup and activate the Anaconda environment from a prompt (Anaconda3 Power Shell on Windows or Terminal.app on Mac):

.. code-block:: bash

    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda create -y --name wisdem-env python=3.7
    conda activate wisdem-env

Note that any future occasion on which you wish to use WISDEM, you will only have to start with ``conda activate wisdem-env``.

Install WISDEM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to directly use the examples in the repository and peek at the code when necessary, we recommend all users install WISDEM in *developer* mode.  This is done by first installing WISDEM as a conda package to easily satisfy all dependencies, but then removing the WISDEM conda package and reinstalling from the Github source code.  Note the differences between Windows and Mac/Linux build systems.

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -y wisdem git
    conda remove --force wisdem
    pip install simpy marmot-agents

For Mac / Linux systems:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install compilers

For Windows systems:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install m2w64-toolchain libpython

Finally, for all systems:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/WISDEM/WISDEM.git
    cd WISDEM
    git checkout develop
    python setup.py develop

Install pyOptSparse (`Optional`)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

`pyOptSparse <https://github.com/mdolab/pyoptsparse>`_ is a package that provides additional optimization solvers with OpenMDAO support:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/evan-gaertner/pyoptsparse.git
    cd pyoptsparse
    python setup.py install
    cd ..

Run Unit Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each package has its own set of unit tests.  These can be run in batch with the `test_all.py` script located in the top level `test`-directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd test
    python test_all.py
